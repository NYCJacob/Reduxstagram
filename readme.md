# Reduxstagram

This is a basic Instragram clone using React and Redux from the 'Learn Redux' course by Wes Boz. 
You can find the free course here <https://learnredux.com/>.  The code is using some outdated modules such as React Router 2.
I hope to update the code and extend this app to take in a live api feed and update some of the React syntax

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

You may get errors because the Sentry.io config file is not part of this repo.   

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
